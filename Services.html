                            <p>No matter the product or service you provide, there is a great chance that it's a commodity, or at the least, you have many comparable competitors.</p>

                            <p>The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.</p>

                            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                            <p>SEO is an asset. It's like buying real estate and investing to remodel your kitchen and bath.  That work will increase the value of your home so that you can sell it in the future for a profit.

                                Using SEO tricks or hacks is like trying to beat the house in Vegas.
